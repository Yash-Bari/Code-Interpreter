# AI Code Interpreter

This Streamlit application empowers users to upload various file types (PDF, Excel, CSV, DOCX) and generate Python code based on the content of the uploaded file and a provided prompt. Leveraging the Google Generative AI API, it executes the generated code within the Streamlit environment.

## Features

1. **File Upload**: Users can upload PDF, Excel, CSV, or DOCX files.
2. **Content Extraction**: The app extracts text content using libraries like PyPDF2, openpyxl, pandas, and python-docx.
3. **Code Generation**: Google Generative AI API generates Python code based on uploaded content and a user-provided prompt.
4. **Code Execution**: The generated code is executed within Streamlit, with output displayed.
5. **Error Handling**: Syntax errors are handled gracefully, with attempts made to correct the code.
6. **Matplotlib Integration**: Matplotlib plots generated by the executed code are displayed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set your Google API key:

```
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key  # On Windows, use set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

2. The app will open in your web browser.
3. Upload a supported file type and provide a prompt.
4. Click "Generate Code" to execute.
5. View the generated code and output.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Relies on Google Generative AI API, which may have usage limits or require payment.
- Processing time may vary based on file size and complexity.
- Limited to specific file types; expanding support requires additional parsing logic.
- Does not persist generated code or results.

## Robustness

- **Error Handling**: The solution includes robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions during code generation and execution.
- **Syntax Correction**: It attempts to correct syntax errors and retries code generation in case of failure, ensuring reliability.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The application is designed to handle a wide range of user inputs and edge cases effectively.

## Code Quality

- **Documentation**: Each function is thoroughly documented to explain its purpose, parameters, and return values.
- **Readability**: Proper variable names and indentation are used to enhance code readability.
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: The code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

## Security

- **Sensitive Information Handling**: Sensitive information, such as API keys, is loaded from environment variables to prevent exposure.
- **Code Execution Environment**: The code execution environment is sandboxed within the Streamlit application, limiting access to system resources.
- **Dependency Management**: Dependency management is handled through a `requirements.txt` file to ensure that only trusted libraries are installed.

## User Experience

- **Intuitive Interface**: The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for uploading files, providing prompts, and generating Python code.
- **Visual Feedback**: Visual feedback is provided during code generation and execution, enhancing the user experience.
- **Error Messages**: In case of issues, error messages guide users on how to proceed, improving overall usability.

By considering these perspectives, the AI Code Interpreter delivers a robust, secure, and user-friendly solution for generating and executing Python code based on diverse file inputs.
